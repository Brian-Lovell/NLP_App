# Natural Language Process App
A web tool that allow users to run Natural Language Processing on articles or blogs found on other websites.


#TerserWebpackPlugin
If you are using webpack v5 or above you do not need to install this plugin. Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box

#css-minimizer-webpack-plugin
This plugin uses cssnano to optimize and minify your CSS.

Just like optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin but more accurate with source maps and assets using query string, allows to cache and works in parallel mode.

# Udacity Review

Meets Specifications
Well done! :star: You have done a great job on this project :fire: I really appreciate the efforts you have put into this project :clap: :clap: Your app is correctly fetching the response and displaying on the UI :fire: The way you have designed the UI and added effects, is really amazing. :fire:

Congratulations on completing the project :v:
Keep Learning :smiley:
Stay Udacious :udacious:

Project Architecture
Project should have a structure like the one in the lessons. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page when started via an npm command like ‘npm run start’

Other requirements:

the Readme file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project. Doesn’t have to be thorough but should have some basic info. Bonus if correct markdown is used

the git ignore file must contain both the node_modules and dist folders at minimum. Other files can be included.

Good work so far! You have made good progress here. Nice project structure like the one used in the course! The app was able to launch after installing packages, running build-prod, and npm start :clap: :clap:

Your Readme file is unique with non-default text in it that is specific to this project.

Finally, your Git ignore file contains both the node_modules and the dist folders. gitignore file is used to exclude unnecessary files while pushing the code to Github.

Overall, great work! :clap: :clap:

Both webpack config files must be present and should be set up similar to the course for development and production.

A build script must run successfully with no errors and generate a dist folder. Bonus if they customized their npm build scripts.

Students should also have a working dev mode, check that webpack dev server is set up and that they have an npm script that starts the server

Great job here!

Both of the webpack config files are present and set up similarly to the course content. The build script ran successfully and without any errors and ultimately resulting in generating a dist folder - great! :v:

I checked that the webpack dev server is set up properly, with working dev mode, and that you have an npm script that starts the server! :smile:

Only one html file is required, but it must be at src/views/ or src/html. Must contain valid semantic html

There will be a minimum of 2 javascript files in the src/js folder. All files in the js folder must be found by webpack.

There must be a styles or scss folder. The project provides a base file, but the header, footer, form, and main files should be added to by the student, similar to the course.

Wonderful file structure! I see an HTML file that contains a valid semantic HTML, multiple JS files in the folder found by webpack, and a <styles/scss> styles folder! You included the header, footer, form, and main files too. I am proud of the work you have done here, you should be too! :clap: :clap:

Functionality
The app should make a successful call to the api on form submission. If this is successful, the api keys and response handling were done correctly. You can check that the api keys are found in server.js or a similar node file. It is not acceptable for an api key to be set in a client facing file (like index.js)

Information from the api response must show up in the view. It is not enough for the response to be logged to the console or saved in js, etc..

Great work! The app makes a successful call to the API upon form submission. This is due to the fact that information from the API response is showing up in the correct view - looks awesome! :tada:

The project must have set up service workers in webpack.

Well done! The project has set up service workers in webpack. Your app is successfully running in offline mode as well.

TIP
A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page.

Go through the below links to get more information about service workers:

Check that the project has Jest installed, that there is an npm script to run Jest, and that the tests all pass. Every src/js file should have at least one test.

Good job here! The project has Jest installed and implements the test cases for the provided JS files. All the tests are working fine :v:

TIP
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

The page built can be very simple, but should include:

A single field form that uses the correct html tags and structure. There should be some attempt to validate the form input. Bonus points if you use regex to correctly check for a URL and give back helpful error messages.

Awesome job! The page includes a single field form that uses the correct html tags and structure. Great job validating the input!
